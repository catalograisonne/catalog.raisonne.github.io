      THE AUTHOR IS ALIVE<br />
      a part of me thinks to yell this in the face of strangers<br />
      and another part of me criticizes myself for the impulse
      <br />
      <br />
      is it not a thing slipped underneath us and reinforced in liberal class or
      another

      <br />
      <i>

        &emsp;goes to college

      <br />
      what kind of spearation belongs between the knowledge produced in a
      college setting and the knowledge produced between anyone else in the
      world?
      <br />
      <br />
      I assumed it was in some capacity a reflection of another, <br />
      that somehow what was taught to me was also subliminally reinforced on a
      'popular-culture' level <br />
      <br />
      my school certainly was not reinventing any wheels.
      <br />
      <br />
      i don tthink of colleges as production centers but maybe more of direct
      reinforcement centers, there is the inforcment of what happens in the
      news, subtle, in the nature of their tone, and the content of their
      conversation propositions <br />
      <br />
      but in a college setting, we say, tell me directly the thing which you
      want me to knowledge <br />
      <br />
      for me in college it felt very clear the guides we operate under that
      reinfocre our ways of thinking...

      <br />
      stepping away from this for rn.

    It’s not that I don’t want to be seen but it’s to the extent that being seen
    contradicts <br />The city, being seen, implies a power in one and a lack in
    the other, you step outside and see all the shades of gray in between<br />
    Gray can never become white, <br /><br />the goal is never that, but rather
    for a system of understanding/seeing to crumble, and shades of grey to
    appear <br /><br />What happens when the lens crumbles?<br />
    Different value scales appear,
    <i> (we are no longer coerced into opposite sides of a polarity</i><br />
    <br />
    complexity outside of known 'complexes',<br />
    the old forms of measurement are out the door <br />Good and bad may be gone
    but their death brings about so many forms of quality , new directions,
    depths

    I am forever beside but unknowing of a knowledge that knows nothing
    <br /><br />Looking for a entire answering but looking only at fragments at
    a time<br />
    To fractal or not to fractal<br /><br />
    The answer always feels like too specific for my tools<br /><br />
    an impulse says to step back, big pictre, step back <br />
    but I think it’s not that, so to speak <br />
    the answer doesn’t feel there, it’s not specificy either<br /><br />
    But a 3rd thing, a different tool, a different system,<br />
    but maybe not a system at all<br />
    Is precision out of question? Quality or quantity? Systems of representation
    and ones of abstraction, personal impersonal?<br />
    The spectrum of literature, something grey in the middle, that embraces
    both. But also neither
    <br />

    i think neither closeness or farness to a thing would be a fair framing,<br />
    that both imply looking therefore they both dont see
    <br /><br />
    <i
      >&emsp;(looking does not imply seeing, seeing does not imply looking)
      <br /><br />
      &emsp; &emsp; quote: conflation of cirulation and content'
      <br /><br />
      &emsp; or to say something does not mean to be heard and to be heard does
      mean you have said something ....

    something here
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>'complexity is not the problem, ambiguity is'</i>
    <br />
    <br />
    the fomrer representation versus abstraction .. fractaled into
    representational being of personal and abstraction being of impersonal, the
    favor going to the less personal, the more abstract, the shinier, the
    smoother,
